# Welcome-Bot
A simple welcome bot


**Installation**

To start you need to install the dependencies. To do this, run `npm i` in a terminal.

**Configuration**

First you have to fill in the TOKEN in the config.json file. To find this token go to the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then you have to modify the messages that the bot will send in the index.js file. 

**Launch**

Once all this is done, you just have to launch the bot by running `node index.js`.


If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me :grin:
